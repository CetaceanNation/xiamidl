# xiamidl

Based on [musicdl](https://github.com/CharlesPikachu/musicdl) by [Charles](https://github.com/CharlesPikachu). Created as a quick effort to make simple, functional, non-spyware downloader for www.xiami.com before it shuts down. Shoutouts to Sharky, Seraphin, and the people in China who don't upload things behind point walls.

You should almost certainly specify proxies in [config.json](./config.json) if you're based in North America, as they block loads of stuff there.
